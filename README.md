Chat Application with Python Sockets

This repository contains a simple chat application demonstrating basic client-server communication using Python's socket library.

Features

Client and Server can send and receive messages.

The Server hosts the chat, and the Client connects to the Server to start a chat session.

Messages are exchanged back and forth until manually terminated.


Requirements

Python 3.x


Instructions

1. Save each code snippet in separate files.

Save the client code in client.py.

Save the server code in server.py.



2. Ensure both client.py and server.py are in the same network (or provide a suitable IP if they are remote).



Usage

Running the Server

1. Open a terminal.


2. Run server.py by executing:

python server.py


3. The server will display its hostname and start listening for a connection.



Running the Client

1. Open a second terminal.


2. Run client.py by executing:

python client.py


3. Enter the hostname or IP address of the server when prompted.



Chatting

After both the Client and Server are connected, they can exchange messages.

The Server starts the conversation by typing a message.

Both the Client and Server can take turns to send and receive messages.



Explanation of Key Functions

socket.socket(): Creates a new socket object.

s.connect((host, port)): Connects the client to the specified server.

s.bind((host, port)): Binds the server to the specified host and port.

s.listen(1): Starts listening for incoming connections (1 at a time).

s.accept(): Accepts a connection from a client.

s.send(message): Sends an encoded message to the other end.

s.recv(1024): Receives a message with a buffer size of 1024 bytes.


Notes

Ensure the server is running before starting the client.

Make sure the specified port (8080) is available for use on both devices.
